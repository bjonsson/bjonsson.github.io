<p>1. Introduction

<p>This playlist is for beginning guitar players who want an easy way to write a song of their own on the guitar. 

<p>A lot of people have thoughts, feelings and experiences burning in their hearts that they need to exorcize! They love music, so they buy a guitar, but get bored repeating a bunch of technical exercises which don’t have much to do with the main reason they wanted to play a guitar: freedom. A release.

<p>Or maybe your family has just had a guitar laying around in the background for years and you haven’t done much with it before, but you’d like to now. 

<p>This method would especially benefit someone who already has some basic guitar skills who feels overwhelmed by the amount of time it takes to master an instrument. With time and effort, a complete newbie can follow along too–it will just take longer.

<p>The goal for this course is for the student to make a song that sounds performable. (In other words, if the student were to really practice and refine the song, they would have a chance at being able to perform at a cafe or an open mic.) 

<p>If this sounds like you, let’s go on to video #2!

<p>2. Minimum Requirements

<p>If you don’t already know how to read chord charts, you will need to know. I’ve linked to a tutorial for how to do that underneath this video, but it is not mine. I like his tutorials though, so if you need more help, he’s got lots of great advice in his videos. You can also contact Jonathan Best, my music teacher, if you email him at info@commusikey.com. His email is linked below. He offers private lessons here in Prescott, Arizona, but he is also pretty tech savvy, so he might be able to help remotely. 

<p>But the minimum requirement to making music is mainly just an impulse to sing and play music! 

<p>For this course, there is so much you can Google if you get stuck, and you will almost certainly have to in this course when we get to keys unless you are a pretty advanced musician.

<p>If you don’t have a guitar, you can use another stringed instrument, like a piano or a ukulele. I just don’t have specific recommendations for anything but the guitar. You can also follow along using Onemotion’s chord app just by clicking the chords. The browser simulates the sound of a piano playing that chord.

<p>Let’s talk about the basics of guitar playing!

<p>3.1 Types of Guitars

<p>There are three different types of guitars you might have or wish to purchase: classical–no place for an amplifier, no place for straps. You have to get a special strap if you don’t want to play it sitting down. I’ll link to that down below. The strings on a classical guitar are often nylon, which is softer. Then there’s acoustic–you can plug this into an amplifier or play without one. There are also places for straps. The strings are often metal. Then there’s electric, which requires an amplifier Demonstrate playing with and without an amplifier. Many different pedals are available which change the sound, and the amplifier should also allow you to adjust the level of distortion available. Demonstrate distortion.

<p>In my opinion, any type of guitar is a fine choice for a beginner. It all depends on what music you would like to play.

<p>3.2 Clipping Nails

<p>If you’re fingerpicking, your nails should look like this. Demonstrate. The left should be clipped down as much as possible, and the right can be kept long. Some people who play stringed instruments even put acrylic nails on their strumming or picking nails. Insert Wiki photo If you’re just strumming with a pick, you don’t need to keep the right hand nails long. But if a guitar player’s left hand nails are too long, those nails will greatly interfere with the ability to press down on the necessary strings, and only the necessary strings. Demonstrate. See, the tone is dampened if I lack precision with the left hand.

<p>3.3 Economy of Motion

<p>Demonstrate as you talk. You don’t want to apply more tension or force than necessary to execute a movement on the guitar. That applies to your whole body, but in particular, pay attention to how tightly you’re gripping the neck. Wrist pain is a bad sign. Don’t grip any harder than you have to for a clean tone that doesn’t buzz. Try not to twist your wrist too much. Using the very tips of your fingers and curling your fingers a little can sometimes help. 

<p>Also, when you’re fingerpicking, take a little time to find out what the easiest way to transition between notes is. There’s often a harder way and an easier way to get from one note to another, and if you experiment a little, you can sometimes improve your performance. Be electricity. Take the path of least resistance.

<div id="myDIV3point4">

<p>3.4 Posture

<p>Some people sit to play the guitar. Some people use a strap to play while standing. I recommend practicing standing rather than sitting. It helps to prevent hunching, and craning to look at your fingers, which you want to move away from doing. Demonstrate

<p>Try to sit or stand relatively straight. You also breathe better for singing if you’re not bent over.

<p>However, the classical guitar is meant to be fingerpicked while seated with the held neck slanted up. This allows for better access to the neck. Demonstrate

<p>There are special classical guitar chairs or stools you can buy to make sure your feet are flat and your posture is consistent because a lot of precision of very small movements is required for classical guitar playing. Insert photo

<p>There are straps you can buy for a classical guitar. I’ll once again link to the one I have below. 

<p>The acoustic is often held casually, with the neck horizontal. It’s usually strummed, but some people do fingerpicking. Demonstrate

<p>The electric guitar can be held in these ways, and musicians also invent strange ways to hold them to try to look cool. My own electric guitar has a strange shape called the flying-v. But electric guitars come in all kinds of other weird shapes and weights that will require getting used to on an individual basis. Les Pauls are probably two or three times heavier than my ¾ Jackson right here. Insert photos

<p>In the end, everyone decides for themselves the neck angle they would like, but it’s usually in this 90 degree range. Demonstrate.

<p>Whatever you choose, you want to try to stick with a consistent posture so that you have that factor out of the way and can work on learning your song rather than adapting to the strings being in a different place.

<p>3.5 Getting the Guitar “Set Up”

<p>Every guitar should get a $30 set up at a local guitar repair shop just to make sure the instrument is basically playable. The very first thing to check is the tuning, which I won’t show here, but I’ll link to an unaffiliated video to how to tune and a tuning app for the browser are down below. 

<p>You don’t want to get discouraged by using a faulty instrument. For example, if you’re pressing the fretboard really, really hard, they might need to check the action, which needs to be fixed by a professional. Demonstrate In my case, my acoustic that my father gave me when I was 16 was a student guitar, and it was made with an action that is too high. In other words, the strings are too high above the fretboard. But my Yamaha doesn’t have a tension rod built in the neck to fix the action. So it was unfixable and I had to buy another guitar. 

<p>When I did, the strings were of a very high gauge and were too loose. In some styles you want that so you can bend the pitch. It sounds like… Demonstrate vocally and with strings. But that combined with how hard I had learned to press from years with the acoustic, meant that my brand new electric guitar would literally never play in tune. 

<p>I practically took the guitar apart trying to figure out what was wrong, but after I took it to my local guitar repair shop, I purchased a “set up,” and he diagnosed the problem and fixed it. In my case, he just had to change the strings. Any guitar repair shop should know what you’re looking for when you ask for a “set up–” it’s common lingo for a basic lookover to make sure everything is okay, so you don’t blame yourself falsely if the instrument sounds strange.

<p>4. Encouragement to be Vulnerable, Honest, and Bold

<p>You will have to be prepared to experiment and sound off-putting at times. You’ll need to be able to turn the inner critic off and on: off while exploring, and on while editing and practicing. 

<p>I took a class taught by artistic coach, Danielle deGuzman, and she held a number of interesting philosophies about creativity. She said that she was determined to explore every side of herself. 

<p>Nothing you do here in this workshop has to be put out in the world. Your test at the end of this workshop is to put your song out into the world on social media, but let’s face it. You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to. So take the upcoming songwriting time to be honest. Be vulnerable. 

<p>Actors have a mantra: the more people that know you the safer you are. We have to put up boundaries all the time in real life to get by. But when you’re writing or performing, you want to temporarily take those down and take intellectual and emotional risks. Because no one loves and empathizes with defensiveness. But if you’re vulnerable, you’ve tapped into the universal. I’d encourage you to lose a bit of your privacy in the name of putting the truth out there, even if it exposes you and makes you vulnerable. At least before the editing process. 

<p>When you make music, you encourage reflection on the lives we live here and now, and I think you’re doing a great thing.

<p>5. Rewriting Lyrics Activity

<p>Now we’re going to rewrite the lyrics of a familiar song. Pick a song you could sing all the way through right now, without even having to look it up. You can look it up. You should look it up. But the song you rewrite should be something you’re really intimately familiar with. 

<p>What I do is I go to a nice cafe with my laptop, I open a Google Doc, I make two columns, then I Google the lyrics and copy and paste them into a second column. Then I use that as a reference to make up a new set of lyrics to go with the song I already know that’s playing in my head. 

<p>Use a rhyming dictionary. Some contemporary poets say that rhyming is dead, but people really seem to respond to it in music. I’m using rhymezone.com. 

<p>My recommendation for writing lyrics is to just go. Just do it. Don’t think about it. Go all the way through this exercise without stopping. Do the whole thing in an hour or two. I rewrote these lyrics in about 30 minutes. Don’t judge anything you write right now. Just go on a trip in your head and speak the truth about what happens there. 

<p>This is actually the second song I wrote for this course. My first one was not safe for work, so I just tried it again, and this one is better for an instructional video. You don’t have to share what you write or commit to it. Just write. You can always do it over again. It’s not a big deal. 

<p>If you need inspiration, just sit there and think your thoughts and feel your emotions that are always streaming in consciousness for you to grab whenever you decide to consider something a bit longer. I’m sure something has been on your mind lately. Something embarrassing, hopefully. Maybe when the dust settles on that issue, you can go back to it. But pick something you can look back on and think about with clarity. For me, I was thinking about belly dancing. 

<p>If there’s nothing on your mind these days, write about sex. I’m serious. My own favorite artists consistently wrote about romantic love, so that’s my go-to. Even if it’s just a little crush, or a fantasy relationship, it’s a way for you to explore your emotions. All your deeper issues come up in a relationship, and that’s writing gold.

<p>So just write! You have the soul of a poet, or you probably wouldn’t be here. You’ve read things that have moved you. They’re honest. They surprise you. They’ve observed the world outside and within. So write about the things that have made you wiser and more loving.

<p>That doesn’t necessarily mean writing something sweet and fluffy. A lot of the things that made you wiser and more loving are very, very dark. 

<p>I was also thinking of an exercise I did in a book about how to write poetry in which you really pay attention to the atmosphere around you. That got me thinking about a coffee date. So I searched some of my past rough work in a journal to see what bits I could remix and use in the present. But most of the songs lyrics I’ve rewritten have not been with the assistance of a journal, so it’s possible to do this quickly without any kind of past inspiration.

<p>When you’re done, print a doc with just your lyrics on it. Then we’re going to pick a key for your song!

<p>Fast forward through a screenshot of rewriting the lyrics.

<p>6. Picking a Key

<p>There are two main ways you can proceed from here. You might want to watch ahead three or four videos and then come back to this activity armed with a little more knowledge. It’s up to you.

<p>But one of the two ways you can proceed is to rewrite the melody with your new lyrics, and then pick the key. If you do that, you can go to a website and find out what key most of the notes you hit are generally in, and then make sure the chords you pick are in that key. The chords for your song will be the notes you hit, but adjusted to fit in that key. 

<p>You can Google charts with the notes in each key. The notes in each key are the roots of the chords you’ll choose. The notes have the same names as the chords. So one chart I found is here: https://www.guitar-chord.org/key-and-chord-chart.html. The link is under the video. The website I recommend for finding the notes your rewritten melody is at https://www.onlinemictest.com/tuners/pitch-detector/. The link is underneath this video.

<p>Demonstrate “She Loves You” fakebook. As you can see, the pitches of the song basically match with the chords in this fakebook.

<p>Rewriting the melody first is probably easier if you have a good “ear,” which is your ability to categorize the music you hear correctly, so if you hear an “F,” you know it’s an F, or you can play back the sounds you hear correctly–that kind of thing. That’s musical ear. You perceive music accurately.

<p>Or, the second way you can proceed, is you can pick a key and some chords right away and confine your melody rewrite to this key. I recommend One Motion’s chord player for this. This link is also below this video. 

<p>This is how I would do it if I were picking a key first. 

<p>I’m going to find out some keys that flatter my voice by going to Online Mic Test.com. Also, get a recording app and record everything you sing. I’ve linked to one down below called Otter. Another good one is Audacity. Make sure to take whatever notes come in handy while you select your key–especially the chords you choose.

<p>Demonstrate picking a key with the Onemotion website.

<p>7. Picking Chords and a Strumming/Picking Pattern

<p>One Motion's chord player has charts which describe how to play each chord, but you might want to Google your chords anyway to see if there are easier ways to arrange your fingers. One Motion really emphasizes barre chords, which I personally don’t enjoy playing as much.

<p>Now, we strum. Now, we pick a pattern. Now, we decide where the chords change. Since I picked out a key first, I’m going to try to work out a vague melody at the same time. I’ll solidify it later. For now, I give myself permission to sound really off-key and off-beat, or to just come up with stuff that sounds cliche’d and all that other stuff we might tell ourselves when we allow ourselves to be insecure.

<p>You might want to try changing chords at the places where there is an emotional shift. 

<p>You can experiment a lot with chords, like trying out the sevens, suspended, or augmented chords. Those are included in One Motion’s chord player.

<p>You should sing while you work out the chords and strumming pattern if you’ve already rewritten the melody. 

<p>There are a lot of different strumming patterns. If you can’t come up with a pattern just strum once per chord shift. Like this:

<p>Demonstrate Let It Go

<p>If you’d prefer fingerpicking, you’re just picking the strings of your chords individually. Try to make a bassline, and try to make a rolling pattern with the strings you pick. You can kind of hear it when I play this song:

<p>Demonstrate Blackbird 

<p>So this part of the course is all about taking the time and trouble to experiment with a little structure from the key exercise. You should record all the sounds you make. 

<p>If you want tips on singing and redoing the melody first, please move ahead to those two videos before doing this activity.

<p>9. Rewriting the Melody Activity

<p>So, videos numbers six through nine, this video being nine, are all activities that can be jumbled together and done non-linearly. If you don’t want to select your key first, you can do this instead. Or, you can do this in conjunction with selecting a key first.

<p>Get out a video or an audio recording app on your phone or computer. If you don’t have one, you can try Otter, which is great on iPhones and Androids or Audacity for the PC or Mac. 

<p>When you’re rewriting the melody, just sing anything that wants to come out. Don’t think too much about it. Just make sure you clock in enough time to really get a decent amount of material to work with. And record everything. You’re probably going to be off-pitch and off-beat and stuff until you solidify your choices. Here’s what I did. I selected my chords first.

<p>Demonstrate and speed up after going slow for a while.

<p>If I didn’t have my chords already, now with the basic melody, I can figure out what chords to select by singing into Online Mic Test’s pitch detector. Write down some of the notes you hit that you think would be a good place for a chord change. The notes I hit will fall into a general key, and you can adjust the chords to be from that key just to keep things simple.

<p>10. Choosing the Parts You Like Activity

<p>Play back your recording. You may have noticed while rewriting the melody that some parts really groove. Or you just like certain diddly doos. Record yourself singing the song with the parts you like until you have something that feels instinctive. Make a new audio file of the song sung exactly the way you would like. This is your reference. 

<p>I find that when I sing to my music, it’s a lot more on pitch with the instrumental accompaniment than when I sing without music. The notes may have the same distance apart, but the pitch might start off a little wrong. If you have that problem too, rehearse to the strumming of the guitar, and make a recording of your singing and playing at the same time. This recording would be what I would turn to if I needed a more accurate reference. 

<p>You should have your chords written down on the lyrics paper and a melody and a strumming or fingerpicking pattern recorded. 

<p>Time to rehearse!

<p>11.1 Rehearsal for the Guitar

<p>You should memorize how to perform your songs. Memorization is so important for guitar players. You don’t want to be out and about in the world and have someone ask you to play something and you can’t because you have nothing memorized. My recommendation for remembering what to play on the guitar is pure repetition. 

<p>If you only have a few simple chords, you can try making a memorable acronym. An acronym just involves assigning a word to a letter. So an acronym for the notes on the lines of an upper musical staff is Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge. EGBDF.

<p>But a lot of people trying to memorize slightly longer or more complicated things use flashcards. Demonstrate flashcards with the lyric and chord pattern and name. Just make a set of flashcards with the chord progression of your songs and review them throughout the day. See if you can remember the chord progression without looking. Try to make it a game!

<p>When it comes to practice, the way I see it is that there are two main ways to practice: practice the bits you need to iron out by just changing between them. Smooth out the transition between chords or notes you’re fingerpicking and just sand out that rough spot. 

<p>But the other way is very important: practice a song all the way through, never stopping if you make a mistake. Try your best to stumble through mistakes and recover and keep playing. This is because you’re always going to make mistakes in a performance, and most people don’t care. They just want to see you enjoying yourself. So when you make mistakes try to just accept what you’ve played–maybe practice that particular section later and smooth it out–and move straight back into the song.

<p>11.2 Rehearsal for the Lyrics

<p>The best way to memorize a monologue is read through it as fast as humanly possible as many times as you can stand over the course of a couple days or weeks or however long it takes for you to remember it. You might think you’ll never get it down, but it will bury itself in your subconscious if you keep at it. 

<p>Print out the words and try to say as much as you can without looking back at the paper. If you find that you forget what to say next, just repeat that transitional part over and over and over again. If you’re trying to memorize something that says, “I parked my car, then I fell into a manhole,” just keep repeating it. If you blank after you say the words “I parked my car,” just say “I parked my car, then. I parked my car then. Car then. Car then. Car then. I parked my car, then I fell into a manhole.  I parked my car, then I fell into a manhole.” Say it when you’re lying down in bed. Whisper it on the bus. Say it while doing vocal exercises. Keep trying to wean yourself off of the paper.

<p>12.1.1 Ego and the Self

<p>Let’s talk about ego. My understanding is that in Buddhism, the ego is the part of you that is there to protect your sense of self from ever being too hurt while also comparing yourself to others and seeing where you fit in a hierarchy. 

<p>The ego is an illusion. It’s a mechanism that offers truths of convenience rather than an ultimate truth. We say things like this is my pen as a truth of convenience, not an ultimate truth. The ultimate truth is, this is just a collection of atoms and will disintegrate one day. No one owns it.

<p>The ultimate truth relating to the self is, there is no self to protect. You’re composed of too many interdependent parts for any one part to be yourself. 

<p>Below this video is a link to a really excellent podcast that goes so much more into explaining the concept of “no self.” I highly recommend it. 

<p>But this is significant for performers because the ego is always getting in the way of being creative. Don’t compare yourself. Don’t hate yourself and who you are deep inside, because there is no self. Don’t be scared of criticism, because there is still no self to defend. If you’re evaluating your worth within a hierarchy, that’s a sign that ego is getting involved. Your worth isn’t dependent on external circumstances. Your worth is there because you are alive and human. You want to carry that compassion for human life with you as you explore your creativity.

<p>12.1.2 Meditation and Deep Breathing

<p>Meditation is a great way for a performer to start fully experiencing the present moment where all singing and performance resides. Meditation develops an awareness of the body, which is where all emotion and all playing technique comes from. 

<p>To meditate, find a quiet place and a flat surface to lie on, close your eyes, and focus your attention on your breathing. Avoid having thoughts. Let your mind focus entirely on the breath and the sensations of the body. If there is pain, thank your body for tolerating the pain. If there is tension in the body, release the tension. Search your body for tension and release it.

<p>Set a timer and try this for 10 minutes.

<p>12.2 Connecting Words to Emotion

<p>Not all songs are going to be super emotional, and that’s fine. But some of them will be very emotional. Audiences really, really want you to share what you feel, generally-speaking. So here’s a five minute acting lesson if you really want to experiment with amping up the intensity of your performance. 

<p>Whatever schools of acting you subscribe to, most will tell you to trick yourself into believing the imaginary conditions of the text you’re reciting. You can do this in a number of ways. You can remind yourself of the character’s purpose for saying or doing what they do. You can ask yourself what they get out of behaving the way they do and empathize with. Then you ask what’s in the way of this person getting what they expect from their behavior. How are they trying to get what they want? Then you live it. You live under the conditions you’ve imagined.

<p>Or you can read a text and figure out what this character must be feeling. And then, you go through your emotional memory, and you remember a time when something happened to you that made you feel the same way. And before you go into the scene, you bring up that memory and recall every detail you can in an effort to re-experience that emotion. And then you play the scene. 

<p>It’s really emotionally draining to dial up the intensity like this, so use caution, but hey, it might work for you. You can try it.

<p>12.3 Post a Video to Social Media Activity

<p>Some artistic coaches, like Danielle deGuzman, believe that sharing is a vital part of the creative cycle, because it encourages feedback from the public which leads to either improvement in the craft or a stronger sense of personal taste and identity as an artist. 

<p>If you can’t play live, which is always great because you can get immediate feedback from the audience, post your song onto social media. There are so many outlets!--Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok. SoundCloud is specifically for musicians. There’s no video, and you can embed the songs you upload onto your own website.

<p>It’s okay if you don’t have professional recording equipment right now. I sure don’t! I have a $100 microphone, and that’s it. That’s good enough for me for now. Going pro isn’t my personal ambition. But it’s just important, I feel, to develop a habit of putting yourself out there, even though there are going to be trolls… even though there are going to be haters. You need other people to give you ideas that you never would have come up with by yourself. And there will always be tons of them. It’s very important to accept how the world is, and you won’t know if you’re too busy introverting. You need to develop the courage it takes to overcome neuroticism.

<p>So this is like your test to see if you pass this class. Post your song to social media.

<p>13. Maintaining One's Skills

<p>Here are some tips for how to maintain your guitar songwriting skills. 

<p>Keep your guitar out in the open. Put it in a place where you see it all the time and can access it really easily. 

<p>Regular practice of about an hour a day is pretty tolerable for most people. If you only have 30 minutes, make it 30 minutes.

<p>Push your technical skills by learning new songs. 

<p>Learn impulsively. Music is vast, so learn what interests you at the time. You’ll get around to the stuff you find boring eventually. 

<p>Play with other musicians. The most substantial way to improve is to join a band. Try looking for people on Bandmix.com or forums. 

<p>Journal. Many artistic coaches recommend keeping a pen and a journal next to you in bed, and when you wake up, fill an entire page with stream of consciousness writing. Go back later and see if there are any gems that you can use. Carry the journal with you, always, and jot down any ideas you have right away.

<p>14. Thank You to Jonathan Best

<p>You made it to the end! Congratulations! 

<p>If you liked this workshop, I really recommend that you check out Jonathan Bests’s music at jonathanbest.bandcamp.com and check out his musical charity at Everybodymusic.rocks. They accept donations if you’d like to send him a little financial thank you! 

<p>Also, if you got stuck, I will once again recommend that you contact Jonathan Best. He’s the one who taught me this method, and he offers private lessons. He is pretty tech savvy, so even if you don’t live in Arizona, he might be able to work something out. 

<p>The goal of Commusikey is simply to get people making music–ordinary people! People who don’t have ambitions to become rock stars. And there is a very practical, action-oriented nature to fulfilling this goal. Commusikey will go to schools, or the town square, or the local farmer’s market and set up instruments and encourage passersby to play with an accountant or a retiree, or a kindergartener who is there beating a conga drum or shaking a pair of maracas. Inherent in that is the idea that all people are musical and have a desire to respond to sound. So mastery isn’t really necessary for this technique of Jonathan’s–it assumes an inherent musicality in all people.

<p>If you're thinking about it, don’t be afraid to contact Jonathan, regardless of the genre of music you prefer. My impression of Jonathan Best, as I have probed and tested him through conversations over the years, is that he has a deeply-held philosophy of complete openness to whatever ways in which music wants to come out of people.
