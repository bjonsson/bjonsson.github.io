    <h1>Brenda Jonsson: Class Notes &gt; HTML, CSS, & JavaScript</h1>
        
        <p>I took this class alongside PHP & MySQL just before the start of the pandemic. I had just graduated with my 
            BFA in Interdisciplinary Arts & Letters, and I missed that crunch I would get in my brain from doing STEM classes.
            From then on, all the way through my Master's degree in Library & Information Science and beyond, I kept taking classes in 
            computer programming and IT--mostly for fun.
        </p>
        
        <p>Here are some of the bigger projects we did in this class.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><a href="csc205sonicsite/Jonsson-assign9.html">Sonic Website</a></li>
            <li><a href="csc205midterm/main.html">Midterm</a> -- This website originally had a working PHP calculator on it, but my computer is just too slow for free PHP/MySQL web hosts, so I'm going to skip those languages until I do paid hosting. So the calculator is missing/broken.</li>
            <li><a href="csc205final/final.html">Final</a></li>
        </ul>
