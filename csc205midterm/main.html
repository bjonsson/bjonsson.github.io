          Losing weight via calorie restriction is fairly simple. Find the current calories burned daily at your size (this is calculated based on height, current weight, sex, age, and activity level. Reduce by 500 calories. 1lb of fat is 3,500 calories, and 7x500=3,500, so you will lose 1lb in a week. Feel free to use the calculator here, or  <a href="https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html" target="_blank">another calculator</a>.).


              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
<!-- This is where the PHP calculator used to be -->

              Losing 1-2lbs per week is the most popular amount recommended by doctors for safe weight loss. Losing weight slowly also reduces the risk of loose skin.

  You must keep checking how many calories you burn as weight loss progresses, since more weight means more calories burned, and less weight means fewer calories burned. So weight loss may be slightly faster or easier at first.

  <h3>Weight Maintenance</h3>

  Counting calories isn’t only a method for losing weight. It’s also a great way to maintain or gain weight. Here, this ballerina is counting her calories to be careful not to go to any extremes with her eating. She is planning to lose a modest amount of weight, but she is careful not to go too far, making sure she eats enough calories to compensate for all the exercise she does.

  <p>
  <h3>Exercise</h3>

  Exercise increases the number of calories that can be taken in and has mental health and longevity benefits as well.
<p>
  <h3>Fad Diets</h3>

  Calorie restriction is flexible and therefore easier to maintain in the long term, unlike fad diets like the maple syrup/cayenne fast, or completely cutting out carbohydrates. If you cheat on a restricted-calorie diet, you can always make it up later in the week by doing a little math and making up the difference over the week. And eating out with friends is always a possibility.
<p>
            <h3>Binge Eating</h3>

  I am a binge eater. But with calorie restriction, I tell myself that I can eat whatever I want, but that I must write it all down. Being faced with how far this pushes me from my goals reduces the number of times I eat unmindfully.
<p>
            <h3>Medical Conditions</h3>

  There are very few medical conditions which prevent people from losing weight. Most of the time, the problem is calories in versus calories out. Conditions like <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/pcos-and-weight-loss-why-it-is-so-hard-2616492" target="_blank">PCOS</a> do correlate with weight gain. This is thought to be because PCOS increases hunger.  But even with PCOS, weight loss is possible just by counting calories, and weight loss improves symptoms.
