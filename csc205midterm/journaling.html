            <p>I knew that when my doctor spoke to me about prescribing insulin as the next step in the progression of my prediabetes, and also said that it was entirely in my control as to whether I would need to progress to needing insulin, that it was time to get serious about weight loss. When he suggested that I restrict my calories to 1,400 a day, I knew it was time to start journaling in order to ensure compliance. 
                
                <p>For me, physically recording the number of calories I ate was essential. I used to keep track in my head, but once I started writing it all down, I was amazed at how dishonest with myself I’d become. It had been so easy to just forget about food I’d eaten earlier, or how much of it I’d eaten. Or I’d have forgotten to keep track of the overall picture of how many calories I’d eaten, ignoring binges and focusing instead on moments of hunger or individual sacrifices made that day. The question of whether I’d lost or gained weight had become a constant, frustrating mystery. It doesn’t have to be though. 
<p>
Some people prefer to use an app to count their calories, but I prefer to journal by hand, looking up foods myself on Google when I don’t know their calorie-count. One of most popular phone apps for counting calories is <a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com" target="_blank">MyFitnessPal</a>, and it might work well for you. However, I have found that it’s simpler for me to carry a notebook or to remember what I’ve eaten and record it at the earliest opportunity.
<p>
Some people find it helpful to purchase a scale to measure food portions. Measuring cups and spoons, however, are something I use daily.  
<p>
Sometimes, you might have to guess the number calories in the items you just ate, especially if you aren’t eating many prepackaged foods. Eventually, you’ll develop a sense of intuition about the calorie content of items. Googling similar foods or averaging the calories of similar foods can help you to make an educated guess. I like to round up, just to make sure I meet my weekly weight loss goal.
<p>
Weigh yourself on the same morning once a week, right when you wake up before doing anything else that day to help keep your measurements consistent. I keep a record of my weight in my journal as well.
<p>
There may be weeks in which you don’t seem to lose weight. If this happens, you might have incorrectly estimated your calories. Your journal allows you to go back and figure out where you might have made an error. There are some <a href="https://www.besthealthmag.ca/best-you/weight-loss/didnt-lose-weight/">other reasons</a> why the scale might not seem to budge, like eating an extra salty meal that causes you to retain water, but you will notice the scale moving eventually if you are consistent and make educated estimates about your calories.
